                <p style="font-size: large; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;" id="firstP">Lord Eddard Stark, also known as Ned Stark, was the head of House Stark, the Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North, and later Hand of the King to King Robert I Baratheon. He was the son of Lord Rickard Stark, older brother of Benjen and Lyanna Stark, and the younger brother of Brandon Stark. He is the father of Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran, and Rickon by his wife, Catelyn Tully, and uncle of Jon Snow, whom he raised as his bastard son. He was a dedicated husband and father, a loyal friend, and an honorable lord.

                <p style="font-size: large; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Eddard's execution and revelation of the illegitimacy of Cersei Lannister's children sparked the War of the Five Kings.</p><br>
                <p style="font-size: large; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Despite his death, Eddard's legacy shaped the future of Westeros in the years that followed. His eldest son Robb was declared the first King in the North since the days of Aegon's Conquest. Although Robb later fell at the Red Wedding, the North's desire for freedom was carried on by Jon's own rise as king following the Battle of the Bastards. Following the Last War, a Great Council in the Dragonpit elected Eddard's last living son, Bran, as the king of the new Six Kingdoms, while his eldest daughter, Sansa, was crowned the Queen in the North.</p><br>
                <p style="font-size: large; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Eddard was a trusted, close friend and counselor of King Robert Baratheon.[7] Both boys were fostered as children by Jon Arryn, the Defender of the Vale, they grew to love each other as brothers and loved Jon Arryn as a father figure. He supported Robert's play for the throne by acting as a general in several major battles. Eddard's sister, Lyanna, who was betrothed to Robert, was purportedly kidnapped by Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, igniting a war. Brandon protested the kidnapping, but his attempt to bring Rhaegar to justice failed. Lord Rickard was summoned to court in King's Landing by Aerys, and both Brandon and Rickard were brutally executed by the Mad King.[8] Their deaths left Eddard to inherit Rickard's responsibilities, serving King Robert instead.</p><br>
                <p style="font-size: large; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Brandon had been betrothed to Catelyn, and Eddard also inherited his brother's bride.[9][9][10] Lyanna died in Eddard's arms during the conflict.[11] Despite his happy family life, Eddard still felt the losses of his family quite keenly, often visiting his sister's tomb to light a candle for her as his daughter, Sansa, remembered.[12] Despite barely knowing each other, Eddard and Catelyn formed a strong and loving marriage, and had five children, Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran and Rickon.</p><br>

            <p class="customfont" style="font-size: large; font-weight: 600;">History</p><br>
            <p style="font-size: large; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Eddard Stark executes a deserter from the Night's Watch named Will. Will tries to warn Eddard about the return of the White Walkers, but Eddard dismisses him as a madman. Eddard's sons Robb, Bran, and Jon accompany him to the execution. Eddard makes a point of telling Bran that the man who passes the sentence should swing the sword and take responsibility for his own decisions.</p><br>
            <p style="font-size: large; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">A raven bearing news of the death of Jon Arryn, Eddard's childhood mentor and foster father, flies to Winterfell. The missive also states that King Robert and much of the royal court is on their way to the castle. Eddard realizes that Robert means to name him as Hand of the King to replace Jon. He ponders refusal. However, when Robert arrives, he makes it clear that he badly needs Eddard's help in King's Landing. He also sweetens the deal by offering to betroth his son and heir Joffrey to Eddard's daughter Sansa. Eddard remains uncertain until a secret letter from Lysa Arryn, Catelyn's sister, implicates the Lannisters in the death of Jon Arryn. Eddard decides to accept to investigate both Jon Arryn's death and a potential plot against the king. He decides to bring both of his daughters to introduce them at court.<p><br>
            <p style="font-size: large; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">On his arrival in King's Landing, Eddard is immediately summoned to a Small Council meeting and finds the capital immersed in political intrigue. Members of the king's Small Council are at the heart of these machinations: Petyr Baelish, the Master of Coin, known as Littlefinger; Varys, the Master of Whisperers; Pycelle, the Grand Maester; and Renly Baratheon, the Master of Laws and Robert's younger brother. Eddard learns that the crown is six million gold dragons in debt, with half of it owed to Lord Tywin Lannister. Regardless, Robert has ordered a lavish tournament to celebrate Eddard's appointment. While acclimating to the political maneuvering, Eddard also tries to repair the rift between Sansa and Arya with mixed results. Sansa rejects his gifts, but Arya is delighted when he hires a swordmaster, Syrio Forel, to train her.</p><br>
            <p style="font-size: large; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Littlefinger tells Eddard that Catelyn has followed him to the city. Eddard is furious when Littlefinger brings him to a brothel, believing he is the victim of a bad joke. Catelyn intervenes as Eddard attacks Littlefinger. She tells Eddard that she has traveled south to report an assassination attempt against Bran. The assassin was killed but was carrying a Valyrian steel knife. Littlefinger identifies the blade as one that he lost in a bet with Tyrion Lannister, and they conclude that the Lannisters were also behind Bran's original injuries. Eddard agrees to try to expose the truth, and Catelyn urges him to trust Littlefinger, her childhood friend. Eddard reluctantly agrees, though he finds Littlefinger obnoxious and dishonorable.</p><br>
