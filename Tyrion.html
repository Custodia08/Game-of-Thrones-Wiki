                <p style="font-size: large; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;" id="firstP">Lord Tyrion Lannister is the youngest child of Lord Tywin Lannister and younger brother of Cersei and Jaime Lannister. A dwarf, he uses his wit and intellect to overcome the prejudice he faces. He is the current Lord of Casterly Rock and Hand of the King to Brandon Stark.</p><br>
            </div>

            <div class="CharacterMain">

            <div class="MainParagrafh">
                <p style="font-size: large; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Tyrion's mother, Joanna Lannister, died giving birth to him, a tragedy which Tywin and Cersei unfairly blame Tyrion for.</p><br>
                <p style="font-size: large; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">When Tyrion was sixteen, he interrupted the attempted rape of a wheelwright's daughter. While Jaime dispatched the attackers, Tyrion helped the girl, named Tysha, recover. They later became lovers and got married in secret. When Lord Tywin learned what had happened, he payed Tysha, a prostitute, to service every one of his guards while Tyrion watched. Jaime confessed he had orchestrated the attack to help Tyrion lose his virginity.  </p><br>
                <p style="font-size: large; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Tyrion accompanies King Robert Baratheon to Winterfell, where he makes the acquaintance of a prostitute named Ros, and gives her a Lannister lion necklace. While lingering outside the feast hall, Tyrion meets Jon Snow, Eddard Stark's bastard son and realizes he is something of a kindred spirit. "All dwarfs are bastards in their father's eyes," he explains.[1] Despite time spent in brothels and taverns, Tyrion is well-read, cunning, and has a fondness for social misfits.</p><br>
                <p style="font-size: large; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">When Prince Joffrey refuses to pay his respects to Lord and Lady Stark after Bran's fall, Tyrion slaps him until he acquiesces. He then breakfasts with his family, where he says he wants to visit the Wall and piss off it. He takes interest in Bran's fall, noting carefully his siblings' glum reactions to the news that Bran is likely to live.</p><br>

            <p class="customfont" style="font-size: large; font-weight: 600;">History</p><br>
            <p style="font-size: large; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">On the road to Castle Black, Tyrion explains to Jon that he likes to read as it keeps his wits sharp. Upon reaching the Wall, he is temporarily rendered speechless by the size and scale of the structure.[14] During his stay, Tyrion observes Jon Snow's superior attitude toward his fellow recruits and recommends he help the others train in order to earn their friendship. Maester Aemon and Lord Commander Jeor Mormont ask Tyrion to use his influence at court to recruit more men for the Night's Watch. While Tyrion is sympathetic, he doesn't believe in danger beyond the Wall.</p><br>
            <p style="font-size: large; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Tyrion bargains with his gaoler, Mord, to get an audience with Lady Arryn and he "confesses" to being a whoremonger and dwarf, before demanding a trial by combat. Bronn agrees to stand as his champion and kills Ser Vardis Egen, freeing Tyrion. Bronn accompanies him on the journey south.<p><br>
            <p style="font-size: large; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Tywin Lannister's forces have been attacking Catelyn's home in the Riverlands ever since she arrested Tyrion. It's not that he cares so much about Tyrion, he explains to Jaime, but because even though Tyrion is the least of them he is still a Lannister, and if they allow one of their own to be taken so easily, they risk losing the respect of the other Houses. The hill tribesmen deliver Tyrion to his father's army, where he learns that Robb Stark is leading an army to war. Tyrion warns his father that Robb should not be underestimated. Tywin agrees to honor Tyrion's alliance with the hill tribes. When Shagga says they will only fight if Tyrion is with them on the field, Tywin also agrees, to Tyrion's dismay.</p><br>
            <p style="font-size: large; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Tyrion is commanded by his father to lead the hill tribes into battle from the front. Feeling that his father means to kill him, Tyrion retires to his tent, where he finds that Bronn has found a prostitute for him, a girl named Shae. Tyrion attempts to learn more about Shae via a drinking game, but finds his questions deflected. Instead he tells her about his own past with Tysha, a wheelwright's daughter. They married and spent several happy weeks together until Tywin learned of the matter. Tywin had Jaime tell Tyrion the truth, that Tysha was a prostitute that Jaime had paid to make his brother happy for a while. Tywin then gave her a piece of silver for every one of his guards she had sex with while Tyrion was forced to watch. Since then Tyrion has never attempted to take a wife or lover, only whores he can pay and send on their way.</p><br>
