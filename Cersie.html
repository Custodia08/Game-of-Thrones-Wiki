                <p style="font-size: large; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;" id="firstP">Queen Cersei I Lannister was the twentieth ruler of the Seven Kingdoms and the widow of King Robert Baratheon. She was the daughter of Lord Tywin Lannister, twin sister of Jaime Lannister and elder sister of Tyrion Lannister. She was involved in an incestuous relationship with Jaime, who was secretly the father of her three bastard children, Joffrey, Myrcella and Tommen.</p><br>
            </div>

            <div class="CharacterMain">

            <div class="MainParagrafh">
                <p style="font-size: large; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">After all her children died, Cersei assumed the throne, making her the first officially recognized queen regnant in the history of the Seven Kingdoms. Her reign came to an abrupt end during the Battle of King's Landing, where she and Jaime were killed. She was the last monarch to sit on the Iron Throne.</p><br>
                <p style="font-size: large; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Cersei was the only daughter and eldest child of Lord Tywin and Lady Joanna Lannister. Cersei was the elder twin of Jaime Lannister and the elder sister of Tyrion Lannister. She was raised in the family seat of Casterly Rock.[14] She was known for her great beauty as a young girl.</p><br>
                <p style="font-size: large; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Cersei's mother died when she was four years old, after giving birth to her younger brother Tyrion. Like her father, Cersei always blamed Tyrion for her mother's death and deeply resented that her mother died so that Tyrion would be brought into the world.[10][15] Tywin was constantly away from home during Cersei’s childhood and teenage years, serving as Hand of the King at the capital, with only infrequent visits back to his seat at Casterly Rock. Coupled with the death of her mother, this meant that Cersei and her two brothers were primarily raised by servants attached to House Lannister. She began an incestuous relationship with Jaime in her youth which continued despite her marriage.[14] While Cersei had other partners in King’s Landing, Jaime always kept himself strictly for her.</p><br>
                <p style="font-size: large; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">When she was about fifteen, Cersei and her friend Melara visited Maggy, a woods witch and reputed fortune teller dwelling in a hut deep in a forest close to Casterly Rock. Melara was reluctant, but Cersei convinced her to go. After rudely awakening her and insisting on having her future foretold, Maggy tasted a drop of her blood and revealed to Cersei she wouldn't marry "the Prince" but "the King", and while the king would have twenty children, she would bear only three children who will wear golden crowns as well as golden shrouds. Finally, she revealed to Cersei that although she would indeed be Queen, she would be cast down by another, younger and more beautiful queen.</p><br>

            <p class="customfont" style="font-size: large; font-weight: 600;">History</p><br>
            <p style="font-size: large; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">In King's Landing, Queen Cersei watches the Silent Sisters preparing the body of Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King, for burial. She and her twin brother, Jaime, discuss the situation and wonder if Jon told anyone else about what he had discovered. Jaime tells her not to worry, since if the king knew the truth they'd be dead already, and that Robert will simply choose a new Hand of the King everything will go on as normal. She suggests that Jaime could be the next Hand, but Jaime refuses, citing the position as too much responsibility and danger.</p><br>
            <p style="font-size: large; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">King Robert decides to travel to Winterfell and ask his best friend, Lord Eddard Stark, to become the new Hand, as well as proposing that his son Joffrey marry Eddard's eldest daughter, Sansa. Cersei, Jaime, and a retinue of courtiers accompany him. When the royal party arrives at Winterfell (the seat of House Stark) a month later, Eddard presents his household to Robert and Cersei, who is greeted much more formally than Robert.<p><br>
            <p style="font-size: large; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">After initial greetings, Robert demands to see the crypts and pay his respects to his former betrothed, Lyanna Stark, stoking Cersei's impatience, eager to rest after a month's travel. After Robert and Eddard depart, Cersei sends Jaime to find their younger brother Tyrion, who has become distracted at the local brothel. That evening, a great feast is held and Cersei and Catelyn Stark exchange cordial words. Cersei seems impressed by Sansa, thinking that she will be a great success at court.</p><br>
            <p style="font-size: large; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">The next morning, Eddard and Robert go hunting, leaving the castle largely empty. Cersei and Jaime liaise in derelict tower. Bran Stark climbs the tower and finds them engaged in sexual intercourse. He is caught watching by Cersei, and Jaime grabs him. Whilst Cersei immediately becomes worried that their secret will be exposed, Jaime feigns Bran with a sense of safety. He asks how old Bran is. When Bran replies "ten", Jaime sighs and pushes him out of the window, musing, "The things I do for love."</p><br>
